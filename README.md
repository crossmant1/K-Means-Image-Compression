K Means Image Compression

- This code takes an image and using K means image compression allows a user to compress an image to a defined number of pixels.
- It groups similar pixels together to their average color.
- To start it picks the number of centroids (starting colors) based on user's input.
- Next it groups the colors closest to the centroids.
- Finally it computes the mean and assigns each pixel in that centroid to that color.

- Any uploaded images need to be in the root directory and named test1.jpg, test2.jpg, etc.
